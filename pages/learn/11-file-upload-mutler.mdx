# File upload with Mutler

#### Challenge 1: File Uploads with Multer

- **Objective**: Implement a file upload system in an ExpressJS application using Multer.

- **Tasks**:
  1. **Create an HTML Form**:
     - Design a simple HTML form for file uploading.
     - The form should send a POST request to `127.0.0.1:3000/file`.

  2. **Set Up Express Server**:
     - Initialize an ExpressJS server that listens on port 3000.

  3. **Integrate Multer for File Handling**:
     - Install and set up Multer in your Express application.
     - Configure Multer to handle file uploads from the form.
     - When a file is uploaded, rename it and save it to a specified directory on your server.

- **Goal**: Users should be able to upload a file through the HTML form, and your Express server, with the help of Multer, should handle the file upload, renaming, and saving process.

    #### Step 1: Create an HTML Form

    First, you'll need an HTML page with a form for file uploading. Here's a simple example:

    ```html {highlight=6,7,8,9,10} showLineNumbers copy
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>File Upload Form</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="http://127.0.0.1:3000/file" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <input type="file" name="file" />
            <button type="submit">Upload File</button>
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    #### Step 2: Set Up Express Server

    Now, let's set up an Express server. If you haven't already, install Express and Multer:

    ```sh npm2yarn copy
    npm install express multer
    ```

    Then, create a server file (e.g., `server.js`):

    ```js showLineNumbers copy
    const express = require('express');
    const multer = require('multer');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    // Multer configuration
    const storage = multer.diskStorage({
        destination: function(req, file, cb) {
            cb(null, 'uploads/');
        },
        filename: function(req, file, cb) {
            const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
            cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix);
        }
    });

    const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

    // Route for file upload
    app.post('/file', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
        res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
    });

    // Start server
    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

    #### Step 3: Running the Server and Testing

    1. **Run Your Server**: Execute your server script with Node.js:

    ```bash showLineNumbers copy
    node server.js
    ```

    2. **Test the File Upload**:
    - Open the HTML file you created in a browser.
    - Choose a file and submit the form.
    - If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message indicating successful upload, and the file should be in the `uploads/` directory on your server with a new name.

    This setup allows users to upload files to your Express server, where Multer handles the file uploading, renaming, and saving process.
