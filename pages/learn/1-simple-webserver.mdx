# Simple Web Server

#### Challenge 1: Basic Server
Use Node.js with the Express framework to set up a basic server. In the route `app.get('/', ...)`, use `res.send()` to return the message ‚ÄúHi, Website! üç£‚Äù to the browser.

#### Challenge 3: More Routes
Similar to Challenge 2, create a new route using `app.get('/contact', ...)`. In the callback, respond with "Contact me" using `res.send()`.

> "Express.js marks a notable departure from the established paradigms of server configurations, as seen in traditional systems like Nginx, PHP, or Apache. What sets Express.js apart is its direct approach to influencing server behavior through code. This contrasts sharply with the conventional reliance on configuration files such as php.ini or nginx.conf. By allowing developers to directly script server functionalities, Express.js opens up a realm of greater flexibility and control, moving away from the constraints of static configuration files."
