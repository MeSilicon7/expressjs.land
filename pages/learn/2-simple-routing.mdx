# Routing Challenge
<hr/>
HTTP verbs represent actions you want to perform on a resource in a web application. Here's a simple explanation for each:

1. **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
2. **POST**: Send new data to a server.
3. **PUT**: Update existing data on a server.
4. **DELETE**: Remove data from a server.
5. **PATCH**: Partially update existing data on a server.
... and more.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You samething with every HTTP verb, but the way you do it is different. For example, you can use the `res.send()` method to send data back to the client for all HTTP verbs. But it's not standard.

  In this challenge, we don't follow the standard rules. we just practice most common HTTP verbs.
