# Route Redirection

#### Challenge 1: Basic Redirection Challenge: 
   - Set up a route in your ExpressJS application named `/oldpath`. 
   - Implement functionality so that whenever a user visits `/oldpath`, they are automatically redirected to a different route named `/newpath`.

#### Challenge 2: Simple Conditional Redirection

    - **Objective**: Create a small ExpressJS application with special redirection rules.

    - **Steps**:
    1. **Setup Routes**: Create two main routes - `/start` and `/end`.
    2. **Cookie Setup on `/start`**: When a user visits `/start`, your application should give them a cookie named `c` with the value `'i love cookie'`. Then, automatically redirect them to a new route `/middle`.
    3. **Middleware for Cookie Check**:
        - Write a middleware function that checks for the cookie `c` with the value `'i love cookie'`.
        - If the cookie is found, the middleware should redirect the user to `/end`.
    4. **Apply Middleware**: Use this middleware on the `/middle` route to enforce the redirection.

    - **Goal**: Only users who have visited `/start` and received the cookie can access `/end` through the `/middle` route. If someone tries to access `/middle` without the cookie, they should be redirected to `/end`.
