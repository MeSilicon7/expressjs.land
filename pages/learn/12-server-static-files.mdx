# Serve Static Files

Why do we need to serve static files? Though we can directly link to our template or .js files .Because we want to keep our application code separate from our static files. This makes it easier to maintain and update our application code without having to worry about breaking our static files. Also it makes it easier to deploy our application to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for faster load times.
Express's built-in `express.static` middleware function makes it easy to serve static files from a directory.
