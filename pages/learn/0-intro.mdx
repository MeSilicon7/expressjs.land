# Introduction
<hr/>

**Why This Project?**
- I set out to challenge myself and thought it would be great to extend this opportunity to others, providing a learning platform.
- Sharing knowledge with budding programmers seems like an excellent way to give back to the community.
- I believe in challenge-based learning as it's the most effective method for me.

**Some Helpful Tips:**
- Adjust your screen size for an optimal view. Use Ctrl + scroll up/down to zoom in or out.

**What This Project Is About:**
- This isn't a conventional course; it's a challenge designed for you to tackle independently.
- If you find yourself stuck, feel free to reach out with a GitHub issue. I'll do my best to assist you.
- Upon completing this challenge, you'll gain a solid confidence in your backend skills. You'll be equipped to build any backend application using any framework.

**A Note to Learners:**
- Feel free to point out any errors or give suggestions for edits.
- Questions are always welcome. I'm here to help you through your learning journey.

**End Goal:**
- By mastering all the topics, you'll become a backend expert, capable of handling various frameworks and building robust applications.

I hope this version aligns with your vision for the project! Good Luck üçÄ

  CommonJS syntax is used in this challenge. If you are using ES6 syntax, you can use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert your code to CommonJS.

  I prefer you to use CommonJS syntax. You find lots of code in internet with CommonJS syntax.

    is exprience needed? 
    No, you can complete this challenge without any exprience.
    But you need to know basic of programming.
    If you don't know basic of programming you can learn from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mei6uVttho)

{/* *By Following This Method You can learn any **express like framework(HonoJS,ElysiaJS)** in Hour. It‚Äôs maybe helpful for your company's new programmer üç£üåè*


    Bullet Proof Code.
    This is practice series. You may found yourself uncomfortable. Most of time i prefer you to use Cli/Terminal/Script cz i think thats much better than GUI. Btw i don't use vim. :). Flex dev only use vim. try to real engineer who make real product for real people. */}

# Some word You need to remember

1. Everyone not follow standard implementations
2. Big Tech Implements lots of Thing with their way
3. Most of youtuber is youtuber, they do their business. don‚Äôt waste time on YT even on programming tutorials. Just Complete your project by yourself.
4. reading docs is good habit
